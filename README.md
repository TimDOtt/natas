# natas
Code I've written while working though OverTheWire's Natas wargame

sqli.py
==================

This is a set of python scripts that I wrote to use SQL Injection on Natas 15, 16, and 17.


sessionid_brute.py
=========================

Another set of python scripts. This time these are used to brute force what the admin sessionid is and use that to gain access to the next level for natas 18 and 19.
